				<h2>The Resilient Hobbit... From Preston</h2>
				<img src="images/articlephotopreston.jpg" alt="picture our shy subject of article!" loading="lazy">
				<p><strong>Once upon a time there was a boy who was raised by his uncle. His uncle had a cherished possession, a ring that he kept with him at all times. When his uncle retired to live with the elves this boy inherited his uncle's ring. One day a wizard returned to the village, and this ring he was given led him to take on a vital quest to ensure that the ring he inherited would be destroyed. He traveled with three of his good friends to a nearby city of men where he was to meet with the wizard. The wizard never arrived, and instead they began their travels with a ranger who led them to the city of the elves where they met the wizard.</strong></p>
            	<p><strong>In this city, their party grew to nine. Their party included the boy and his three friends, the ranger who had already traveled with them, the wizard who had started the boy on the quest, a new warrior, and an elven archer. They all began a grand journey together, but as their adventure continued members were divided from each other. Only one life of their nine was permanently lost to death, but before their quest was over nearly all had been taken captive or injured at some time or another. Their quest was naturally met with success after many difficult trials. What you probably don't know about this brave adventurer who you want to call Frodo, is that he is a real person who lives in Preston.</strong></p>
