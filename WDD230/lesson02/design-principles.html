                <h3><strong>Visual Hierarchy</strong></h3>
                <p>Youtube</p>

                <img src="images/Youtube.png" alt="Home Page Youtube">
                <p>Here in the home page of youtube, it is observed a clear example of <strong>Visual Hierarchy</strong> where the 
                    youtube divided your content with the most to the less relevant content, also have good pattern in the visual
                    field when can see some elements that "stand out" like in the left side the bar menu, the other one in the top of the
                    right corner that is the log in and the last one that I want to add is the search field in the top of the page with some focus.</p>

                <h3><strong>Hick's Law</strong></h3>
                <p>Airbnb</p>
                <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">https://www.airbnb.com/</a>
                <img src="images/Airbnb.png" alt="Home Page Airbnb">
                <p>Here in the home page of Airbnb, the site uses the Hick's Law to give for the user a lot of options for things
                    to do in the website, here in the main page we have options of places to visit or search for cities, states or even
                    countries that we want to check more, we can log in our account and more other stuffs. This is the trick for the site,
                    because when you pass more time in the site, better for them, because they will know more about you and also what areas
                    they will need to give more attention to improve the site and a lot more benefits, so this method is very useful.</p>

                <h3><strong>White Space and Clean Design</strong></h3>

                <img src="images/Google.png" alt="Home Page Google">
                <p>Here in the home page of Google, we can see one of the best examples in my opinion about white space and clean Design.
                    The reason you can observe by ourself, but here in the main page they just had the basic and objective to search, they useful
                    very well the white space here and remove all the interferences or distractions with a lot of information that others pages have.</p>
