        <h2>Helaman Rodrigues Final Project</h2>
        <h3>Description of my website:</h3>
        <p>This website was developed for a accountable company that was searching and inviting new clients to work with them, they are located in the state of São Paulo, one of the states of Brazil.</p>  
        <p>The objective idea is to know more about the city, the weather that have there and to fill the form to join to the company.</p>

        </ul>       
       <h3>What Problems did you have and how did you resolve them?</h3> 
        <p> My main problem was to get the api of the weather site connected in my website. After some hours watching videos about API, I could done.</p>
        <p>Other problem that I had was to make the layout responsible and different for mobile, desktop or in other words in the small and medium/large css. I fixed them checking my others apps that I developed before and trying to put the same conditions there.</p>
