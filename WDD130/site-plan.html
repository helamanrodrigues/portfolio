      <h3>Experiences</h3>
      <p>
        This page will be focus in tell some experiences of travelers around the world and how they did the best trip with low cost.<br>
        Like a example is one of my friends that take a visit this year for europe, here is your words: <br>
        I traveled with my family (4 people) to Europe in July 2018, where we spent approximately 20 days. As it is high season, many things like hotels and tickets were more expensive, but we managed to get good discounts on Airbnb and rented a car in the second half of the trip, which also took more account of riding the train all the time. Eating there every day ends up being very expensive, so it is better to make more snacks and buy food to make / eat at the hotel / inn.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        This page like the name above said, it is about the creator of the site and his plans for the future.
        Bellow the description and goals of the creator: <br>
        Hello World! It so nice to meet all of you, so here is my little introduction:

        My plan for my degree rigth now is the Applied Techonology BS, I have a lot of desire and interest to learn more about this world of programming and techonolgy, I know that this is the future and I like a lot to learn and have more acknowlodge, this will be a great semester.

        One of the things that I do in this time of quarantine is read, I like books with adventure, a little of mystery with drama, the book that I'm reading is men who didn't love women. Also I like to play some sports, my favorite is soccer but I also like voleyball.

        I live with my family, me and my parents with my two young brothers, I'm the oldest one, but also I have one oldest sister that live in Texas.

        About my career currently I work in a company that builds race cars like fórmula 1, for example: mclaren and lotus. One of the reasons to study programming is to change my career, I like to work with race cars but I felt that this is not my passion, so I search for another and programming caught my attetion.

        So this is a little about me, if all of you have any questions, feel free to ask.
