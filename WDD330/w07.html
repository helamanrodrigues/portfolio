        <h2>Helaman Rodrigues Final Project</h2>
        <h3>Description of my App:</h3>
        <p>My TravelApp is a dynamic website-application that you can fill the form with your informations like city, country, zip code, name, birth date and others info to check the location that you are looking for.
            The app provides you to save information of someplace in the world that you want to know or visit by google maps and to plan for visit there someday. </p>
        <p>So this are the steps of the app:</p> 
        <ol>
            <li>Click on New Button to add the new user</li>
            <li>Enter your name</li>
            <li>Enter your last name</li>
            <li>Enter your company</li>
            <li>Enter your address</li>
            <li>Enter your city</li>
            <li>Enter your state</li>
            <li>Enter your zip code</li>
            <li>Enter your country</li>
            <li>Enter your phone</li>
            <li>Enter your birth date</li>
            <li>Save your info</li>
            <li>Go down the form to check the map of the place that you selected and the weather condition of this place</li>
            <li>You can Edit the info, Clear the info or create a New one.</li>
            <li>If you want to delete the user that you created, just select the X button </li>
        </ol>   
        <p>The objective idea is to be able to have a special information that will help you decide and learn more about the place that you want to go.</p>
        <h4>CSS Features used:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Media query: To make the page responsive.</li>
            <li>Hover: To change the color of the search button.</li>
            <li>Box-sizing + moz-box-sizing + webkit-box-sizing: apply a natural box layout model to all elements</li>
            <li>Clearfix: Force an element not to collapse</li>
            <li>Root: To make easier and organized to select the colors</li>
        </ul>       
       <h3>What Problems did you have and how did you resolve them?</h3> 
        <p> My main problem was to get the api of booking travel, but I can't pay for that, so I decided to change my project using the google maps.</p>
        <p>Other problem that I had was to make the layout responsible and different for mobile, desktop or in other words in the small and medium/large css. I fixed them checking my others apps that I developed before and trying to put the same conditions there.</p>
        <p>The other point was the javascript to make work the interaction with the final user, one of my friends give me a help with that.</p>
        
        <h3>How did you use the coding topics from the course?</h3>
        <p>I could say that in my final project I saw the most important topics such as: creating dynamic pages, using external information through APIs, good handling of CSS, etc.</p>
