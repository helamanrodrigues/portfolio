        <h3>Chapter 14: HTML APIs Completed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Attribute:  it is used to store data in from web pages html. (The data attribute only saves information for its local use.)</li>
            <li>Two parts of an attribute: Name and Value </li>
            <li>Web Storage APIs are used mostly to store information about the user and storing application -specific information. It can also help you to use geolocation, hardware, etc.</li>
            <li>Local Storage: is a native object that has many properties and methods to store data </li>
            <li>In my own words: localStorage serves a provisional data base that works on the browser.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Geolocation API</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It is used to obtain the location of a device using the Navigator object</li>
            <li>The method that will give you the position is called getCurrentPosition()</li>
            <li>Notes: I always wanted to know how to ask the user for permission on notifications</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Example:<br>
        if(window.Notification) {<br>
            Notification.requestPermission()<br>
            .then((permission) => {<br>
            if(Notification.permission === 'granted') {<br>
            new Notification('Hello JavaScript!');<br>
        }<br>
        </p>
        <p>This will ask the user for permission to show alerts or notification on the browser</p>

        <h3>Multimedia</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML5 introduce the audio and video tag to insert that type of content on the web.</li>
            <li>Controls can be added it by adding the “controls” property, by doing this we can manipulate the videos.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML5.1 is the latest incarnation of the Hypertext Markup Language. It covers a variety of technologies, including several APIs that are accessible using JavaScript.</li>
            <li>data- attributes help to embed custom data into a web page that can then be used to enhance the user experience with JavaScript.</li>
            <li>The Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the user’s device in a similar way to cookies, but without the same storage restrictions.</li>
            <li>The Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic coordinates of the user’s device, as long as the user gives permission.</li>
            <li>The Web Worker API can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks in the background, which helps to avoid websites becoming unresponsive.</li>
            <li>Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the internet, and allow real-time, two-way communication.</li>
            <li>The Notification API allows you to display notifications on the user's system.</li>
            <li>The < audio > and < video > elements can be employed to embed audio tracks and video clips in a web page. They also have a Media API that can help control the playback using JavaScript.</li>
            <li>The canvas element can be used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text, and images on a web page in real-time using JavaScript.</li>
            <li>A shim or polyfill is a piece of code that adds support of missing features to older browsers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ch12: Canvas, SVG and Drag and Drop</h3>
        <p>Canvas: is a space that is used to draw graphics. The use of canvas is only possible with using JavaScript.</p>
        <p>It is possible to draw lines, shapes and even images and videos on canvas.</p>
        <p>Note: It’s important to specify the width and height in the canvas tag an example will be:</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            canvas id="myCanvas" class="myCanvas" width="200" height="200"><br>
                Sorry! Your browser doesn’t support Canvas.<br>
            /canvas<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        The reason why we don’t declare the width and the height in CSS is because on CSS it determines how large would be the canvas coordinate system.
        -We are not limited to squares or rectangles to create other shapes for canvas we use paths
        Paths: will set a list of points, to connect them a draw a different shape

        </p>

        <h3>Drag and Drop</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There is an API that we can use to make our webpage more dynamic with the user. And is the Drag and drop. This means that it allows you to drag files </li>
            <li>Important Steps:</li>
            <li>Add the draggable attribute and set it equal to True</li>
            <li>Dragover and drop</li>
            <li>Add the prevent default, so it lets the program to execute the functions as planned</li>
        </ul>
