        <h3>Ch.13 AJAX Completed</h3>
        <p>Definition of AJAX: “is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading them.”</p>
        <p>In the past web pages were only static, this mean that they only contained information that was previously save or that it was local (from the same program) Ajax lets you to have a dynamic page.
        </p>
        <h3>Clients and Servers</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is designed on the client side to add dynamic features to the web page.</p>
        <p>Asynchronous: when a request of data us sent the program does not have to stop and wait for the response.</p>
        <p>API’S: Is a collection of methods that allow external access to another program or service.</p>
        <p>Json() Method is used to transform a stream of JSON data into a promise that resolves to a JavaScript object.</p><br>
        
        <h4>Fetch API</h4>
        <p>The fetch method only has one argument which is the URL for example:</p>
        <p>fetch('https://example.com/data')</p>
        <p>.then( // code that handles the response )</p>
        <p>.catch( // code that runs if the server returns an error )</p>
        <p>. Then() will take care of the response’s object if everything goes as planned. The response also has some attributes that helps you to know I the response was successful, what status it has, and we can even create conditionals to check is we obtained that information we wanted.</p>
        <p>. Catch() will handle possible error and return a response to them. </p>
        <hr>
        <br>
        
        <h4>Headers Interface</h4>
        <p>Headers are used to pass additional information about the request or response.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>const headers = new Headers({ 'Content-Type': 'text/plain', 'Accept-Charset' : 'utf-8', 'Accept-Encoding':'gzip,deflate' })</p>
        
        <h4>Living Standard</h4>
        <p>The Fetch API is something that is still changing in other words “experimental” even when most eb pages use that method, that could change in the future. </p>
        <p>At present this is the most used method to make dynamic pages, however, because it is still experimental, more functions may be added in the future and even the way they are expressed may change, but this should motivate us to keep up to date with the new technologies.</p>
        
        <h4>Summary:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ajax is a technique for sending and receiving data asynchronously in the background.</li>

            <li>The data can be sent in many forms, but it is usually in JSON.</li>
                
            <li>Ajax can be used for making partial page updates without having to do a full page reload.</li>
                
            <li>Ajax can be used for communicating with external APIs.</li>
                
            <li>Ajax requests can be made using the Fetch API.</li>
                
            <li>The Response interface allows you to control the response received from a request or to create your own response objects.</li>
                
            <li>The Request interface allows you to create a request object that contains information about the request being made, such as the URL and headers.</li>
                
            <li>The Headers interface allows you to create HTTP headers that can be added to a request or response object.</li>
                
            <li>Requests can retrieve data using a GET request, or send data using a POST request.</li>
                
            <li>The FormData interface makes it easier to send data from forms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Part 2 Notes</h2>

        
        <h3>Ch8: Forms Completed</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Forms are used almost in every web page (Search bars, Information request to you emails, phones, etc.).</li>
            <li>Forms is an HTML Element that gathers all the information from the user.</li>
            <li>The form.reset() – will erase all the information, and it will take the form back to its original state.</li>
            <li>We can use JavaScript before sending the information to the server.</li>
            <li>Note: I prefer to use the placeholder in the input fields.</li>
            <li>JSON.stringify() is used to convert an object to JSON string</li>
            <li>Note: I like that in this chapter it teaches you how to access to every input depending on its type.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Form Validation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Is used to check if the user enter the information that was expected for example:</li>
            <li>document.forms will return all the forms from the page. Also we can be more specific if we want.</li>
        </ul>


        <h4>Required:</h4>
        <p>label for="username">Username:</p>
        <p>input type="text" id="username" name="username" required</p>
        
       <p>-The username is required to send the information from the Form. Nothing will happen until that input is filled correctly.</p>
       <p>-It is possible to make validation filters using JavaScript as well</p> 
        
        

        <h3>Using FormData Objects Effectively Completed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If the elements from the Form element don’t have the attribute “name” the data object will be empty, it does need to have a name object.</li>
            <li>ev.preventDefault is used to keep the data that we have.</li>
            <li>Is always a good practice to send the from object and its keys to the console, So we can see and check if it is sending the correct information or not.</li>
            <li>In case the servers requesting a json file, we need to create function to do that. </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>MDN: Client-Side Form Validation Completed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Client-side form validation is the process of checking if the user entered the correct information in the form. This process is made before sending the information to the server.
            </li>
            <li>One of the benefits of forcing user to input the correct data is that we can better protect their information.
            </li>
            <li>Two Main types of Validations: Built- in form validation from HTML5 and JavaScript Validations.
            </li>
            <li>We can add conditions to the validation on HTML 5 I did not know that. 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Summary:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Forms are the primary method used for entering data into a browser.</li>

            <li>Forms have a variety of controls that are used for entering different types of information.</li>
                
            <li>HTML5 has a large number of new input types that are beginning to be implemented in modern browsers.</li>
                
            <li>document.forms will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page.</li>
                
            <li>form.elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form.</li>
                
            <li>Forms have focus, blur, and change events that fire as a user interacts with the form.</li>
                
            <li>Forms also have a submit event that can be used to intercept a form before it’s been submitted.</li>
                
            <li>The information entered into a form can be read or updated using the value property of the form controls.</li>
                
            <li>The HTML5 form validation API can be used to automatically validate a form, but only at a basic level, so a custom validation script may be required.</li>
        </ul>
