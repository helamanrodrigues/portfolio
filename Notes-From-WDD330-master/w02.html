        <h2>Ch 9: The Window Object Completed</h2><br>

        <p>-The WINDOW is like the universe that involves all of the functions, classes, etc. we can access to it for example:</p>
        <p>X = 6</p>
        <p>Print(x)</p>
        <p>Print(window.x) (The result will be 6)</p>
        <p>-Window is like the main object and all of the other things are it properties.</p>
        <p>-Windows is used to for the pop ups messages. </p>
        <p>-The window object can give you pretty much all the information about the browser: host name, host, URL , href, etc.</p>
        <p>-Window.Open can open a new window, you can even set the dimensions for it for example: </p>
        <p>const popup = window.open('https://sitepoint.com','SitePoint','width=400,height=400,resizable=yes');</p><br>

        <h3>Screen Information </h3>
        <p>-It is possible to get the information from the screen where the web page or application is on.</p>
        <p>Some of the properties that we can get are height, width, available height, available width, and color depth.</p><hr>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>-Are the responsible that keep track of the user choices. The purpose is get information to narrow your search and information.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Animations</h3>
        <p></p>-In my opinion one of the best features of using window is for the animations, I think they make the website more dynamic and friendly. I will try to use it more often.</p>

        <h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The window object is the global object in a browser.</li>
          <li>Global variables are actually properties of the window object in a browser environment.</li>
          <li>alert, confirm(), and prompt() are all methods of the window object, and open dialogs that halt the execution of the program.</li>
          <li>The window.navigator object gives information about the user’s browser and operating system, although it can be unreliable</li>
          <li>The window.location object provides information about the URL of the current page.</li>
          <li>The window.history object keeps information about the pages that have been visited in the session.</li>
          <li>You can open, close, resize, and move windows (although, this doesn’t mean you should!).</li>
          <li>The window.screen object provides information about the user’s screen.</li>
          <li>document.write() is an archaic method of writing text to the document and should be avoided.</li>
          <li>Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between requests using the document.cookie property.</li>
          <li>The window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after a set amount of time. It can be canceled using the clearTimeout() method.</li>
          <li>The window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function. It can be stopped using the clearInterval() method.</li>
          <li>The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by utilizing the browser's built-in graphics capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Question: In what cases it is better to do animations on JavaScript instead of CSS ? </h3>
        <br><br>
        <h2>MDN the Content Template Element Completed</h2><br>
        <p>-The template element is basically use to create tables that are going to be show or loaded in a certain time. They will appear once the user loads the page we could say that is use to load the page dynamically. </p>
        <p>-It works with JavaScript.</p>
        <p>-The Template element only has global attributes</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>Part 2</h2>

        <h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Bugs are unavoidable in code, and it’s best to find them early rather than later.</li>
          <li>JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string "use strict". This can be used in a whole file or just a single function.</li>
          <li>Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practice and conventions.</li>
          <li>Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling it, helping to avoid an exception being thrown.</li>
          <li>The console and browser’s built-in debugging tool can be used to interactively find and fix bugs in code.</li>
          <li>Exceptions can be thrown using the throw statement.</li>
          <li>An error object is created when an exception occurs.</li>
          <li>Any code placed inside a try block will pass any error objects to a catch block when an exception occurs. Any code inside a finally block will run if an exception does or does not occur.</li>
          <li>Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code that passes the test, then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented.</li>
          <li>The Jest framework can be used to test your code.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Review about Single Pages </h3>
        <p>Single-page applications control navigation so that we re-use the active Document instead of sending a request to a server.</p>
        <p>Routers are typically used to power route matching within a single-page application. Route matching is done when the location changes, determines which route matches the new location, and then triggers a re-render of the application.</p>
        <p>In-app navigation is performed using the History API. The default click behavior for anchors is overridden to use pushState() and replaceState() to navigate. A popstate event listener is used to detect navigation with the browser’s forward/back buttons. The click handler and event listener should both inform the router about the navigation to trigger the route matching cycle.</p>

        <h3>The HTML5 Template element Completed</h3> 

        <p> After reading about template element and using it in the individual assignment from this week I was able to see and learn about its potential. 
            Definition of Template element: “it provides an easy way to define a reusable fragment of HTML that can be manipulated just like you would the contents of the document itself, but without the overhead of actually updating the DOM or having to compile and parse strings of HTML.”</p><br>
        <p>In my own words is a segment of code that could be reusable and manipulated.</p><br>

        <p>To have an efficient implementation of the template element, it is necessary to create it as a container, then only change some attributes so that it can be used dynamically.</p>

        <h4>NOTE: I should learn more about how to use the browser tools to detect bugs or problems.</h4>
