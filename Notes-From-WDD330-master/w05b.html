        <h3>Introduction to functions, execution, contexts, and call stack and How to Understand Callbacks & Higher Order Functions Videos Completed.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> JavaScript reads the code line by line - I think this is one of the most important things to remember. When we understand that JavaScript codes are read line by line. It was interesting this time to see how the programming works. Not so much on the programmer's side but how computers interpret our code and execute it. Without a doubt, learning about this helps us develop our logic when solving problems.</li>
            <li>Variables are spaces in the global memory that store a specific value or are undefined.</li>
            <li>Functions: are meant perform a specific action, they use variables that are declared inside the function or in the global memory. They follow an order of instructions "remembering the values of the variables" to create an output.</li>
            <li>Execution: when the functions are called. But it is actually the process of jumping back an forth to the global memory to use the variables and perform an action that will bring an specific value</li>
            <li>A local memory (Variable environment) where anything defined in the function is moved:  At the end, we have to keep track or our function calls to keep track of the values and to return a correct result.</li>
            <li>Call Stacks: Keeps the order starting from the global environment on how each function was called. This process helps us to have an order and a way to keep track of the value of the variables.</li>
            <li>Note: "When I have these foundational pieces built out with clarity, and completeness. All the hard parts follow more naturally." I think that is true now that I saw this video my way of thinking about code has changed, and I think I am going to be able to read the code in a similar way as the computer would do it.</li>
        </ul>
       

        <h3>Extra from How to Understand Callbacks & Higher Order Functions (Video)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I think the key is to follow the call stack to keep track of the value in the memories (local and global) and creating a new result.</li>
            <li>It goes first to the global memory where functions and variable are saved, then Is in the local memory where variables are stored (First Array == Argument) in the example of Diving by 2 each element of the first the array and after executing the function, it creates an array and continue to push the output for each element (Second array).</li>
        </ul>
